We are designing a REST API -> JSON REST API
""Note we will fetch data from - https://mockaroo.com/ in this case"" -> Generate fake date for testing 


Note - "If we see /api we know it will through JSON but if /api not exit it will through normal HTML doc [Good practice for Hybrid]"

GET/api/users -> List all users   (List of all user in JSON Data ) ✅
GET/users -> List all users   (in HTML DOC Reader[Good for Web -> Through HTML ]) ✅  //Server Side Rendering

"Dynamic path parameters"
GET/users/:id -> ":" -> symbolizes dynamic
GET/users/1 -> Get the user with ID 1   ✅
GET/users/2 -> Get the user with ID 2   ✅


POST/users -> create new user

PATCH/users/1 -> Edit the user with ID 1

DELETE/users/1 -> Delete the user with ID 1
